## Description

This is a little full-stack project, a food application where you can visualize and add new meal recipes.
It was at first my last school project, and was made in two days. I decided later on to make some changes and to deploy it online.
Front-end (React) and back-end (Node) are deployed on vercel and database is stored on GoogleCloud Database (mySQL).
